			<!-- BACKGROUND/GENERIC INFORMATION -->
			<h1><u>Quick Background and Context</u></h1>
			<p>
				I come from a town in the middle of nowhere in South Carolina, and my graduating class had around 70 people in it.
				Out of those 70 people, I managed to graduate valedictorian (big accomplishment, I know).
				In high school, my main focus was on music rather than anything computer related.
				I thought that I would go on to study Music Education and become either a band director or a private instructor.
				However, when I applied to UofSC (the only college/university I applied to), they denied me because my audition wasn't good enough.
				I made it into the university with test scores and such, but I would have to reaudition my sophomore year to try and become a music major.
				Later that summer after I got the news, I realized I hated teaching, so I had to figure out another course of action.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first idea was to become a math major. However, the only job opportunities for people with a degree in math are academia or data analytics, neither of which interest me.
				That's when I decided on computer science. I took AP Computer Science Principles my senior year of high school, and it was really easy to me.
				I changed my major from undecided to computer science and went on with my life until sophomore year of college.
				I found out that graduating with a degree in math only required a few more classes, and coming into college with a lot of AP/dual enrollment classes, I was able to take those extra classes and still graduate on time.
				Now, I'm a double major in computer science and math. Yippee. However, even though I'm a computer science major, it's still not a driving factor in my life.
				I chose the major not necessarily because I enjoy it but because I'm good at it and don't hate it.
				It's something that I'm not to upset about because the pay and flexibility will allow me to do other things outside of my career that I want to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the career aspect, I love computers. I believe it's a skill that everyone should pick up at some point.
				Being able to program something yourself and actually use it gives some sort of comforting independence that is hard to find elsewhere.
				It's nice to sit back and look at a working website/program and think "Wow. I did that."
				On top of this, it's really good for curious minded people like myself.
				I'm able to create programs to find solutions to random things I think about in my daily life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anywho, here's a little less about the field and more about me.
			</p>


			<!-- INTERESTS -->
			<h1><u>Interests</u></h1>
			<div class="interests" id="myInterests">
				<h2>Computer Science</h2>
				<p>
					Computer science isn't necessarily a huge interest for me, but I do find a small fascination in computer graphics.
					I think generation of 3-dimensional environments and the rendering of such environments is really neat, and it's something I wouldn't mind pursuing in a career.
					Another thing I've become fascinated with (while not particular to computer science) is typesetting, particularly LaTeX.
					I'm not sure why, but the creation of documentation that actually looks nice and is easy to navigate is something I'm interested in.
					This might stem from the fact that some program documentation is utter trash, and when I create things, I like the documentation to be neat and orderly.
				</p>

					My GitHub can be found <a href="https://github.com/cSwiggitySwooty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>
					Like I mentioned in the above section, band was a driving factor for me in my high school years.
					I was the percussion captain and section leader for five years (our marching band was formed my 8th grade year, and I was percussion captain/section leader until I graduated).
					Marimba is my favorite instrument to play, but since I'm in college in a confined, tiny apartment, that's not really an option anymore.
					As such, I've had to find other instruments to play, and I've picked up guitar since my dad plays it.
					I played guitar when I was around 13, but I instantly got bored and went back to drums (they seemed a lot cooler at the time).
					However, my sophomore (?) year of high school, I felt the urge to pick it back up and do it justice.
					Since then, I've been playing acoustic. I'm really slack on my practice though, and I spend most of my time doing maintenance training and playing the same few songs over and over.
					I'm sure my roommate gets tired of hearing me play and sing If You Could Only See by Tonic.
					I've been thinking about purchasing an electric drumset for the apartment, but while that will satisfy my craving for beating things with sticks, there isn't really any room for it here.
					I don't mind sticking to the guitar though because it's something I enjoy, and it gets me by.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to music tastes, my list is very wonky.
					My #1 favorite band of all time is Nothing But Thieves.
					They're the only band I've found that I can listen to 24/7 without getting tired of, and I'm not sure why that is.
					Other than them, a few of my favorite bands include TOOL, A Perfect Circle, Three Days Grace, 3 Doors Down, and Ripe.
					When it comes to anyone but NBT, I'm more of a "I like that one song by them and not much else" kinda guy.
					Due to this, I have a ton of songs outside of the Alternative/Rock genre that I like such as Eternal Youth by Rude, Do It for Love by P-Holla, some NF, Eminem, and Hopsin songs, and many others.
				</p>

				<h2>Gaming</h2>
				<p>
					Gaming is a huge hobby of mine, and it takes up a ton of my time.
					I'm mainly a PvE co-op player with games like Monster Hunter, Minecraft, and Terraria.
					However, I do play League of Legends (terrible game, don't play it) and a few other PvP games.
					My favorite game of all time so far is without a doubt Skyrim.
					I've spent countless hours on that game, and I'm pretty sure I've done everything in the vanilla game and many of the most popular mods.
					Originally, I played on Xbox, but I currently play on PC (which is superior in almost every way btw).
					My favorite series of all time has to be the Dark Souls series.
					The lore in the series is the best I've ever encountered, and the score by Yuka Kitamura and Motoi Sakuraba combined with the atmosphere of the environment is just unreal to me.
				</p>

				<h2>Parkour</h2>
				<p>
					I always wanted to get into parkour when I was a wee lad, but I never had anyone in high school that wanted to actually go train with me.
					Due to this, I never actually did much until college.
					When I first came to college, I didn't actually know there was a parkour club here, so I never actually went out and trained.
					My sophomore year, I found out about the Movement club, and I decided to go to a session.
					The session was extremely awkward for many reasons, but I ended up not going back that year.
					However, a friend of mine from the eSports club convinced me to go back and try it again because he does it.
					Because of this, I decided to go back, and now me and him train at least twice a week.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm still pretty crummy at parkour, and most of my stuff revolves around terrible kongs and pres.
					The only thing I'm actually decent at are my standing pres because my legs have been trained from walking around Columbia which seems to constantly be uphill.
					Flips are still foreign territory to me because my air awareness just isn't there yet.
					Currently, I've been taking a more straight line approach to everything with a freerunning mindset, but hopefully that'll change once I start learning simple flips and such.
