			<h1><u>Hello!</u></h1>
			<p>
				My name is Swig, and I'm a computer science and math double major at the University of South Carolina.
				This page is more of a personal rambling page than anything, and most content on this website will be only relevant to me, but I figured I might as well share it with everyone else and get a taste of web development.
				This page is hosted through GitHub Pages. The repository for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/cSwiggitySwooty/cSwiggitySwooty.github.io">here</a> for those interested.
				My general GitHub can be found <a href="https://github.com/cSwiggitySwooty">here</a>.
				For more information about me, you can visit the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> page.
			</p>

			<h1><u>What Is This Website?</u></h1>
			<p>
				This website is a mesh of my entire life, focusing on elements from my computer science degree, parkour progress, and music progress.
				It's basically everything that goes on in my brain but put on a webpage that you (hopefully) can digest.
				If you're here for a specific facet of my life, you can likely find it in the corresponding location in the navigation bar found at the top.
				If it's not there, it's something that I either don't want to share or didn't deem worthy of sharing. Below, you can find the latest post I have made in each category for ease of access.
			</p>

			<h1><u>Why Should I Continue?</u></h1>
			<p>
				You shouldn't. This website isn't for you. It's for me.
				This website is purely for me to keep track of everything I've done.
				It's to put things here that I couldn't necessarily fit on a resume.

					<p>
						This project consisted of using artificial intelligence (particularly a genetic algorithm) to align images after a damage event.
						This project is based on a report done for my Artificial Intelligence class at the University of South Carolina (CSCE 580).
						The report for this assignment can be found [HERE].
