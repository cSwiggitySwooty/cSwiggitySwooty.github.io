            <h1><u>Discord</u></h1>
            <p>
                My primary nonformal form of communication is typically done through Discord.
                This is because I'm on Discord almost all of the time, and it is quicker to reach me there than it is through email or any other means.
                The link to my Discord is <a href="https://discord.com/invite/DTcEGmewMK">https://discord.com/invite/DTcEGmewMK</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h1><u>Instagram</u></h1>
            <p>
                My Instagram should be a second form of nonformal contact in case I need to be reached.
                My Instagram page can be found at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_swig/">https://www.instagram.com/_swig/</a>.
                Typically, my Instagram will contain similar content to that which is listed on this website, but it will be updated much more frequently as I don't have to sit down and code Instagram posts.
            </p>

            <h1><u>Email</u></h1>
            <p>
                For any sort of formal communications, please refer to my email address: <a href="mailto:acolinstuart@gmail.com">acolinstuart@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
