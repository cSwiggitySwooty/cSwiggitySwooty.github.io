			<!-- BACKGROUND -->
			<h1><u>Background</u></h1>
            <p>
                My junior year, I decided to take a class on Artificial Intelligence (CSCE 580).
                I assumed it would be interesting and that I would find some motivation to continue the computer science field.
                I don't think I could be more wrong.
                The class was extremely bland, and I don't feel like I learned much at all.
                The one interesting thing, however, was the final project.
                I worked with a graduate student who had already begun the project but hadn't gotten too far.
                For his project, he has an image of a sheet of metal on a table that is then converted into a height map using a laser.
                After this, the metal plate is then struck with some sort of impact, and another scan is taken.
                This results in two images: one that is the unaltered metal plate and another one that is the same plate but after a damage event.
                Our goal was to isolate the damage that the plate took.
                In other words, find the difference of the images.
                However, aligning these images by hand is tedious and wouldn't be very practical.
                Since this is an AI class, you can only guess what we decided to do.
				Here is an example of this alignment.
            </p>

			<!-- GENETIC ALGORITHM INFORMATION -->
			<h1><u>Genetic Algorithms</u></h1>
			<p>
				The best way we sought to do this was through a genetic algorithm.
				In case you're unfamiliar, a genetic algorithm is an optimization algorithm.
				Given some scoring function, it will either try to minimize or maximize that function.
				For us, we needed the difference to be as low as possible, so we were using it in the form of minimzation.
				A genetic algorithm differs from other optimization algorithms through the use of chromosomes and alleles.
				Let's say we have some sort of scoring function f(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn).
				Instead of inputting these separate values into the function, we can instead append them together to form what is known as a chromosome.
				Therefore, we have c0 = x1|x2|x3|...|xn. A better example can be shown in the image below.
				In this image, you can see that each input variable corresponds to a section in the chromosome.

			<p>
				The next important topic in genetic algorithms comes in the form of crossovers.
				A crossover occurs when two chromosomes swap sections with one another, as shown in the image below.
			</p>
			<img src="crossover.png" alt="Genetic Algorithm Crossover" class="center">
			<p>
				Apologies for the blurriness, but I'm not bothered enough to fix it.
				However, you can see here that P1 and P2 are swapping sections with each other to produce two children: C1 and C2.
				This can usually transcend allele boundaries, but for our project, we made it so that we would only swap entire alleles or none at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final thing to talk about before we get into our project is mutation.
				Mutation is simple really. Every generation, a single bit has the chance to swap to the opposite vale.
				For an example, see the image below.
			</p>
			<img src="mutation.png" alt="Genetic Algorithm Mutation" class="center">
			<p>
				Again, sorry for the blurriness, but I really don't care.
				In this case, the 14th bit is swapping from a 0 to a 1.
				This is in an attempt to keep the system from going sterile and not producing any unique children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that we've covered the basics of genetic algorithms, we can finally get into our implementation for this problem.
			</p>

			<!-- GENERATION 1 IMPLEMENTATION -->
			<h1><u>Generation 1 Implementation</u></h1>
			<p>
				For our first attempt at this problem, we decided to go with 8 alleles, each 8 bits in size.
				This results in a 64 bit string that we can use for input into our evaluation function (which I will not go into here).
